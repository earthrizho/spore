## Git Branching Strategy

### Branch Structure
- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - Individual feature branches
- `hotfix/*` - Emergency fixes for production
- `release/*` - Release preparation branches

### Branch Naming Convention
- Features: `feature/feature-name`
- Hotfixes: `hotfix/issue-description`
- Releases: `release/v1.x.x`

### Workflow

1. **Feature Development**
   - Create feature branch from `develop`: `feature/feature-name`
   - Develop and test feature
   - Create PR to merge into `develop`
   - Code review and approval required
   - Delete feature branch after merge

2. **Release Process**
   - Create release branch from `develop`: `release/v1.x.x`
   - Bug fixes and documentation updates only
   - Merge into both `main` and `develop`
   - Tag release in `main`
   - Delete release branch after merge

3. **Hotfix Process**
   - Create hotfix branch from `main`: `hotfix/issue-description`
   - Fix critical production issue
   - Merge into both `main` and `develop`
   - Tag hotfix release
   - Delete hotfix branch after merge

## Application Architecture

### Tech Stack
- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- State Management: React Context API
- Backend: Firebase
- Authentication: Firebase Auth
- Database: Firestore
- Hosting: Firebase Hosting
- Storage: Firebase Storage

### Core Components

1. **Context Layer**
   - AppContext: Global application state
   - AuthContext: User authentication state
   - NotificationContext: System notifications

2. **Feature Modules**
   - Estimates
   - Projects
   - Tasks
   - Calendar
   - Analytics
   - User Management

3. **Services Layer**
   - Firebase Service
   - Authentication Service
   - Storage Service
   - Notification Service

### Data Flow
1. User interactions trigger React component events
2. Events are handled by context actions
3. Services process business logic
4. Firebase operations execute
5. State updates propagate through context
6. UI updates reflect new state

### Security
- Firebase Security Rules
- Role-based access control
- Data validation
- Secure API endpoints
- Environment variable protection

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading of components
- Firebase query optimization
- Image optimization
- Caching strategies
- Bundle size optimization

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for components
- Integration tests for features
- E2E tests for critical paths
- Firebase emulator testing
- Performance testing

## Deployment Pipeline

1. **Development**
   - Local development
   - Firebase emulator
   - Feature testing

2. **Staging**
   - Automated builds
   - Integration testing
   - UAT environment

3. **Production**
   - Release approval
   - Automated deployment
   - Monitoring
   - Rollback capability
